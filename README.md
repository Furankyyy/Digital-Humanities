# How to Use

In your terminal, run:

```git clone https://github.com/Furankyyy/Digital-Humanities.git```

```cd Digital-Humanities/```

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Then run:

```python app.py```

A server address will show up. Copy and paste it in your browser to access to website.

Then, in the ```archive``` directory in the github repo, find the txt file with the corresponding presidents' name and year. Copy and paste the whole file's text into the "Input" box. For the document name, you can input anything, it's only used to indicate which document a sentence is from.

Do this for all of the SOTU addresses you would like to analyze (you can follow the example in the assignment), then hit **PLOT**. Wait for a few minutes (depending on your machine's resource).
